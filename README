Terminal.app theme based on the Textmate Twilight theme—no teenage vampires!

I'm sure there's lots of little tweaks I can make…if you see one shoot me an email: hi@timtrueman.com

Changes in this fork:
- Modified colors to better match the original TextMate theme
- Added iTerm2 Theme
- Added Sequel Pro Theme
